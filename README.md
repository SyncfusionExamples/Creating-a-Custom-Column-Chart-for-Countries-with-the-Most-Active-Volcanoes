## Description
Column charts are useful for displaying changes in data over a specific period of time or for illustrating comparisons between different items.

## Customization 
By default, column charts plot discrete rectangles for the given values. We can customize the shape of the series as desired using the [CustomTemplate](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ColumnSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ColumnSeries_CustomTemplate) property.

We can customize the color, border, and width of the doughnut segment using the [Palette](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeriesBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeriesBase_Palette), [Stroke](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeries_Stroke), and [StrokeThickness](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeries_StrokeThickness) properties respectively. 

## Watermark
We can add any view to the plot area using [Watermark](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.SfChart.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_SfChart_Watermark) support, which is useful for adding any relevant data.

This article explains how to visualize the most active volcanoes in different countries since 1950 using [WPF Column Chart](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/charts/wpf-column-chart). 

Volcanoes erupt, spewing molten rock, ash, gases, and other substances from the Earth's crust. Their intensity varies, ranging from mild to devastating. They play a significant role in shaping the Earth's landscape and can have both positive and negative effects on the environment.
